# Technical Preferences

<!-- project.yaml at the repo root is the machine-readable source of truth for
     engine, specialists, naming, performance, platform, and testing.framework.
     This file is the human-readable LEGACY FALLBACK: agents and skills resolve
     each key from project.yaml first and fall back here only when the
     project.yaml key is absent. /setup-engine dual-writes both.
     Forbidden patterns and allowed libraries are NOT migrated — they live only
     in this file. Populated by /setup-engine; updated as decisions are made. -->

## Engine & Language

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6.3
- **Language**: GDScript (gameplay/UI scripting), C# (performance-critical systems), C++ via GDExtension (native only)
- **Rendering**: Compatibility
- **Physics**: Godot Physics 2D

## Input & Platform

<!-- Written by /setup-engine. Read by /ux-design, /ux-review, /test-setup, /team-ui, and /dev-story -->
<!-- to scope interaction specs, test helpers, and implementation to the correct input methods. -->

- **Target Platforms**: Mobile, Web
- **Input Methods**: Touch
- **Primary Input**: Touch
- **Gamepad Support**: Partial
- **Touch Support**: Full
- **Platform Notes**: All UI must be usable by touch. No hover-only interactions.

## Naming Conventions

`.gd` files use GDScript conventions. `.cs` files use C# conventions. `project.yaml` records the GDScript column, because gameplay scripting is GDScript.

- **Classes**: PascalCase (both languages)
- **Variables**: `.gd` snake_case; `.cs` public members PascalCase, private fields `_camelCase`
- **Signals/Events**: `.gd` snake_case past tense; `.cs` PascalCase with an `EventHandler` suffix
- **Files**: `.gd` snake_case matching the class; `.cs` PascalCase matching the class
- **Scenes/Prefabs**: scenes for `.gd` roots are snake_case; scenes for `.cs` roots are PascalCase
- **Constants**: `.gd` UPPER_SNAKE_CASE; `.cs` PascalCase

## Performance Budgets

- **Target Framerate**: 60
- **Frame Budget**: 16.6ms
- **Draw Calls**: [TO BE CONFIGURED]
- **Memory Ceiling**: [TO BE CONFIGURED]

## Testing

- **Framework**: gdUnit4
- **Minimum Coverage**: [TO BE CONFIGURED]
- **Required Tests**: Balance formulas, gameplay systems, networking (if applicable)

## Forbidden Patterns

<!-- Add patterns that should never appear in this project's codebase -->
- [None configured yet — add as architectural decisions are made]

## Allowed Libraries / Addons

<!-- Add approved third-party dependencies here -->
- [None configured yet — add as dependencies are approved]

## Architecture Decisions Log

<!-- Quick reference linking to full ADRs in docs/architecture/ -->
- [No ADRs yet — use /architecture-decision to create one]

## Engine Specialists

<!-- Written by /setup-engine when engine is configured. -->
<!-- Read by /code-review, /architecture-decision, /architecture-review, and team skills -->
<!-- to know which specialist to spawn for engine-specific validation. -->

- **Primary**: godot-specialist
- **GDScript Specialist**: godot-gdscript-specialist (.gd files — gameplay/UI scripts)
- **C# Specialist**: godot-csharp-specialist (.cs files — performance-critical systems)
- **Shader Specialist**: godot-shader-specialist (.gdshader files, VisualShader resources)
- **UI Specialist**: godot-specialist (no dedicated UI specialist — primary covers all UI)
- **Additional Specialists**: godot-gdextension-specialist (GDExtension / native C++ bindings only)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for cross-language architecture decisions and which systems belong in which language. Invoke GDScript specialist for .gd files. Invoke C# specialist for .cs files and .csproj management. Prefer signals over direct cross-language method calls at the boundary.

### File Extension Routing

<!-- Skills use this table to select the right specialist per file type. -->
<!-- If a row says [TO BE CONFIGURED], fall back to Primary for that file type. -->

| File Extension / Type | Specialist to Spawn |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Game code (.gd files) | godot-gdscript-specialist |
| Game code (.cs files) | godot-csharp-specialist |
| Cross-language boundary decisions | godot-specialist |
| Shader / material files (.gdshader, VisualShader) | godot-shader-specialist |
| UI / screen files (Control nodes, CanvasLayer) | godot-specialist |
| Scene / prefab / level files (.tscn, .tres) | godot-specialist |
| Project config (.csproj, NuGet) | godot-csharp-specialist |
| Native extension / plugin files (.gdextension, C++) | godot-gdextension-specialist |
| General architecture review | godot-specialist |
